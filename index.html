        This website will guide us in exploring problem-solving through the Design Thinking approach, a user-focused and
        iterative methodology that emphasizes understanding user needs, redefining challenges, and creating innovative
        solutions. By engaging in stages like empathy, ideation, prototyping, and testing, we will develop the ability
        to approach complex problems with creativity and effectiveness. This process will arm us with valuable tools to
        conceive impactful ideas and bring meaningful solutions to life. <br><br>

        To me, creativity represents the capability to think outside the box, generate fresh ideas, and embrace
        uniqueness. Furthermore, our sir explained the vision of CMR University, which is: ‚ÄúTo nurture creativity to
        drive positive global change through research and innovation.‚Äù This reflects a commitment to fostering
        innovation and empowering individuals to contribute significantly to the world.

                <li>Accounting: In accounting, documentation involves maintaining records that support financial
                    transactions and reports. This includes invoices, receipts, contracts, bank statements, and other
                    evidence of business activities. Proper documentation ensures transparency, accuracy, and compliance
                    with regulations.</li>
                <li>Healthcare: Documentation refers to patient records, medical histories, treatment plans, and other

            <ol type="1">
                <li> <b>Creativity: </b>The ability to think outside the box and generate unique, innovative ideas is
                    essential
                    for a
                    designer. Creativity drives originality in design solutions.</li>
                <li> <b>Attention to Detail:</b> Designers must focus on every small detail, ensuring that their designs
                    are
                    precise,
                    clean, and professional.</li>
                <li><b>Problem-Solving Skills:</b> Designers often address complex issues through their designs. They
                    need
                    strong
                    problem-solving skills to find effective solutions that meet the client's needs.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Technical Skills:</b> A designer must have proficiency in design software (such as Adobe Creative
                    Suite,
                    Figma,
                    or AutoCAD) and a solid understanding of design principles like typography, color theory, and
                    layout.
                </li>
                <li><b>Communication:</b> Effective communication with clients, team members, and stakeholders is vital
                    to
                    understand

                <li><b>Adaptability:</b> The design world is ever-changing, and a good designer should be able to adapt
                    to new
                    trends,
                    tools, technologies, and project needs.</li>
                <li> <b>Time Management:</b> Designers often juggle multiple projects with tight deadlines. Good
                    organizational
                    and time
                    management skills are crucial for meeting those deadlines while maintaining quality.</li>
                <li>
                    <b> Empathy:</b> Understanding the needs and preferences of the target audience helps designers
                    create more
                    user-friendly, appealing, and functional designs.

            In class sir showed us a video were oral b appointed a designer to design the toothbrush especially for
            kids. They observed that kids weren't able to hold the brush properly so the designer made small
            toothbrush
            for kids but even though the brush was small the kids weren't able to hold it . Later the designer
            observed
            that the toothbrush was not so thick and had no grip so then they designed the toothbrush which was
            thick
            and had good grip . This design helped oral B company to rule for 18 months in this industry. From this
            we
            can understand that the design must observe the things </div>

            <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>
            Design is a fundamental discipline that combines creativity, problem-solving, and functionality. Whether
            developing a digital interface, designing a product, or shaping an environment, designers must strike a
            balance between aesthetics, usability, and human-centered thinking. By adhering to established principles
            and processes, designers can create solutions that are not only effective and visually appealing but also
            address the needs and experiences of the people they are designed for.

                During the session, our sir organized a fun and engaging activity to help us bond as a team. The task
                was simple but hilarious: each of us had to draw a portrait of one of our teammates and write about
                their favorite and least favorite things. Since none of us were skilled artists, the results were both
                funny and entertaining. <br><br>

                For example, Datta drew a portrait of Chetan, while Chetan drew Datta‚Äôs, and the results had everyone
                laughing. Bushra's sketched vijay's, while I drew chiran's face, and in return, Vijay drew mine. The entire
                activity turned into a source of laughter, with everyone‚Äôs quirky portraits adding to the fun. <br><br>

            In this session, we learned about the steps in <b> Design Thinking</b>. The five steps of Design Thinking
            are: <br><br>

            1. Empathize: Understand the users and their needs through research, observation, and direct engagement.
            This step is focused on gaining deep insights into the challenges users face, and it serves as the
            foundation for all subsequent steps. <br><br>

            2. Define: Clearly articulate the problem based on the insights gathered in the Empathize phase. This step
            involves pinpointing the core issue or challenge that needs to be addressed, ensuring that the problem is
            well-defined and understood. <br><br>

            3. Ideate: Generate a wide range of creative solutions to the problem. Brainstorming sessions and exploring
            different approaches are crucial in this phase to develop innovative ideas that could potentially solve the
            problem. <br><br>

            4. Prototype: Create simple, tangible representations of the ideas, such as models or mockups. These
            prototypes are used to visualize potential solutions, test different concepts, and identify areas for
            improvement. <br><br>

            5. Test: Test the prototypes with real users to gather feedback and insights. This stage helps refine the
            solution, validate its effectiveness, and determine how well it addresses the defined problem. <br><br>

            Design Thinking is not a linear process. For example, after testing a prototype, you may return to the
            <b>Ideate</b> phase to rethink or modify solutions. During the <b>Empathize</b> phase, you might identify
            new problems that require redefining the challenge. <br><br>

            ---

            Stakeholder Types: <br><br>

            There are three types of stakeholders in a project: <br><br>

            1. Primary Stakeholders: These are individuals or groups who are directly affected by the organization‚Äôs
            actions, such as employees, customers, or patients. They experience the direct impact of the decisions made.
            <br><br>

            2. Secondary Stakeholders: These are individuals or groups who are indirectly affected by or have an
            influence on the organization. For example, suppliers, partners, or regulators who may not be directly
            impacted but still play a role in the organization‚Äôs operations. <br><br>

            3. Tertiary Stakeholders: These are external groups or individuals who are marginally involved or affected
            by the organization, such as industry regulators, competitors, or advocacy groups. Their influence is
            usually more peripheral. <br><br>

            ---

            Types of Research: <br><br>

            1. Primary Research: This involves collecting original data directly from sources through methods such as
            surveys, interviews, observations, or experiments. It provides firsthand information that is directly
            relevant to the project. <br><br>

            2. Secondary Research: This involves gathering data that has already been collected and published by others,
            such as academic papers, market reports, or industry studies. It helps in understanding broader trends and
            gathering background information without primary data collection. <br><br>

        The activity not only brought a lot of laughter but also helped us get to know each other better in a
        fun and creative way. It was a lighthearted opportunity to bond as a team, allowing us to appreciate
        each other's unique personalities. We ended the activity by taking a group picture with our sir, which
        made the moment even more memorable. <br><br>

            Design is a dynamic discipline that integrates creativity, problem-solving, and functionality to craft
            innovative solutions. Whether designing a digital interface, a product, or an environment, the focus
            lies in harmonizing aesthetics with usability and a human-centered approach. By adhering to key
            principles and systematic processes, designers can create solutions that are not only visually appealing
            but also practical and responsive to real-world needs.

                1. Distance for Hostellers:  <br><br>

                Challenge: The college is situated approximately 1 kilometer from the hostel. This distance can pose a
                significant inconvenience for hostellers, particularly for those who have to make this journey multiple
                times a
                day. Factors such as weather conditions (rain, heat), physical health, and time constraints can make
                this daily
                trek burdensome.

                Impact: The long walk may lead to fatigue, particularly for students with busy schedules or those who
                might have
                difficulty walking long distances. This can affect their punctuality, attendance in classes, and overall
                academic performance. The issue highlights the need for a more efficient solution, such as improved
                transportation options or better facilities at the hostel.

                2. Menstrual Hygiene Accessibility: <br><br>

                Challenge: The provision of menstrual hygiene products in the hostel and college is limited, often only
                available in emergency situations. This lack of accessibility can cause significant stress and
                discomfort for
                female students during their menstrual cycles.

                Impact: Inadequate access to menstrual hygiene products can lead to health issues, feelings of
                embarrassment,
                and distraction from academic responsibilities. Addressing this issue is crucial for promoting gender
                equality
                and ensuring that female students feel comfortable and supported in their learning environment.

                Challenge: The college canteen frequently experiences overcrowding, particularly during peak hours such
                as lunch
                and dinner. Students often face long lines and extended wait times when trying to order food.

                Impact: The inefficiency of the current system can lead to frustration and decreased satisfaction with
                the
                overall dining experience. Students may feel rushed to get to their next class, which can affect their
                nutrition
                and wellbeing. Finding ways to streamline the ordering process, perhaps through technology or better
                organization, could alleviate this problem.

                4. Limited Water Facilities:  <br><br>

                Challenge: Many students encounter difficulties in accessing clean drinking water on campus. The
                scarcity of
                convenient water stations can make it challenging for students to stay hydrated throughout the day.

                Impact: Dehydration can negatively affect concentration, energy levels, and overall health. Addressing
                this
                issue by installing more water dispensers or improving existing facilities could significantly enhance
                students'
                daily experiences.

                Data Collection and Decision-Making

                To prioritize these issues, your group took a proactive step by creating a Google form to collect
                feedback from
                a broader student audience. This survey allowed students to indicate which problems they encounter most
                frequently, providing valuable insights into the collective priorities of the student body.

Problems Faced in Government Hospitals <br><br>

The primary challenge in government hospitals is to improve the quality of healthcare services. Key issues include poor hygiene standards, inadequate facilities such as insufficient access to clean water and limited canteen options, and inefficiencies in patient management, leading to long queues and unnecessary referrals. Communication barriers, particularly language differences, further complicate patient care. Additionally, the shortage of medical staff, especially doctors, and the need to make healthcare accessible and affordable to all remain significant hurdles that need to be addressed. <br><br>

                problem better. To conduct primary research, the team will have to directly interview people such as
                doctors, patients, nurses, and other staff at the hospital by asking them specific questions. So that we
                will get firsthand information of difficulties and needs in the system from the interviews or surveys
                that we will take.This our the question which we are going to ask Discuss with our team what key
                questions we would ask to stakeholders during the primary research phase. These questions are very

        <div class="session-6-txt">Secondary research involves collecting data from existing sources such as newspaper
            articles, journals, reports, or reliable websites. It is used to validate findings, understand background
            information, or identify trends. However, the professor emphasized that secondary research should rely on
            credible sources. Websites like Quora or review platforms are not considered reliable because they often
            contain subjective opinions or unverified information.

            Instead, secondary research should come from trusted sources like government reports, scientific studies,
            academic journals, or reputable news outlets.</div>
        <div class="session-6-image">
            <img src="main-page-image/session6-2.webp" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="session-6-txt">The professor emphasized that secondary research adds depth and context to a project,
            complementing and supporting primary research findings. This session enhanced our understanding of how to
            approach research systematically and filter information effectively to ensure credible results. It also
            highlighted the importance of properly citing sources to maintain academic and professional integrity.
            <br><br>

            Additionally, the session introduced us to several essential tools and techniques for structured and
            empathetic problem-solving. Here's a detailed overview of what we learned: <br><br>

            Stakeholder Map <br><br>
            Vignesh Sir introduced the concept of the Stakeholder Map, a visual tool that illustrates the
            interconnections between various stakeholders within a system or organization. Stakeholders can include
            individuals, groups, or entities that influence or are affected by a specific problem or process. To clarify
            the concept, he used the example of a Dairy Milk company. He explained how stakeholders such as farmers (who
            supply milk), manufacturers (who process the product), distributors, retailers, and customers all play
            interconnected roles, forming a dynamic ecosystem that sustains the business.
        </div>
        <div class="session-6-image">
            <img src="main-page-image/session6-3.webp" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="session-6-txt">
            We were guided on creating our own Stakeholder Map for the problem we are addressing. For example, in our
            project on government hospitals, stakeholders could include doctors, nurses, patients, cleaning staff,
            administrators, and government bodies. By mapping out their roles and connections, we gained insights into
            their influence on the system and how they are affected by or contribute to the problem. <br><br>

            Why Web Map<br><br>

            We also learned about the Why Web Map, a tool that helps uncover the root cause of problems by repeatedly
            asking "Why." The process starts with identifying the main issue and progressively asks why the problem
            exists, digging deeper into its underlying causes. <br><br>

            For example, if the issue is "Patients face delays in receiving treatment," the questioning process might
            unfold as follows:<br><br>

            1. Why do patients face delays? ‚Üí Because there is a shortage of doctors. <br>
            2. Why is there a shortage of doctors? ‚Üí Due to limited recruitment opportunities. <br>
            3. Why is recruitment limited? ‚Üí Because of insufficient government funding. <br>
        </div>
        <div class="session-6-image">
            <img src="main-page-image/session6-4.webp" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="session-6-txt">This iterative questioning process continues until we reach the root cause, allowing
            us to focus on solving the fundamental issue instead of just treating the symptoms.
            <br><br>
            Empathy Map <br><br>

            Lastly, our teacher introduced the Empathy Map, a tool designed to help us understand and empathize with the
            experiences and emotions of our stakeholders. The map is divided into key sections, each focusing on
            different aspects of the stakeholder's perspective.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="session-6-image">
            <img src="main-page-image/session6-5.webp" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="session-6-txt">1. What do they feel? <br><br>

            What are the emotions they experience? <br><br>

            Are they stressed, frustrated, happy, or relieved? <br><br>

            1. What do they hear? <br><br>

            What kind of feedback or conversations are influencing them? <br><br>

            Are they hearing complaints, encouragement, or instructions? <br><br>

            1. What do they see? <br><br>

            What does their environment look like? <br><br>

            Are there overcrowded waiting rooms, unhygienic conditions, or helpful resources? <br><br>

            1. What do they say? <br><br>

            What are they verbally expressing about their situation? <br><br>

            Are they voicing concerns, gratitude, or suggestions for improvement? <br><br>

            This method helps us deeply understand the stakeholder‚Äôs perspective, which is essential for developing
            solutions that are user-focused and practical. <br><br></div>

        <div class="session-6-txt"> <b>Summary </b><br><br>

            The Stakeholder Map, Why Web Map, and Empathy Map are powerful tools that provide a structured approach to
            understanding both the problems at hand and the people affected by them. They guide us in thinking
            critically while fostering empathy, helping us develop human-centered solutions. These insights will be
            instrumental in addressing the challenges we have identified in our design thinking project.</div>

<h1>Ad Factorum Mundi</h1>
<div class="game" id="tinkercad">
    <div class="text-game">
        In today‚Äôs session, we entered the Prototype phase of our Design Thinking process, focusing on tools and techniques to create effective prototypes. We were introduced to two key applications. The first was Tinkercad, a platform that allows users to design 3D models. Tinkercad offers features such as circuit design, 3D block modeling, and a user-friendly interface, making it an excellent choice for beginners looking to explore 3D design.</div>
        <div class="game-image">
            <img src="main-page-image/tin.webp" alt="Game">
        </div>
        <div class="text-game">Hari Sir demonstrated Tinkercad in detail, explaining its features and functionalities. He guided us through the process of designing basic 3D models, providing us with insights into how physical prototypes can be developed for real-world applications. <br><br>

            The second tool introduced was a website and app design platform, ideal for creating digital prototypes for apps and websites. Once our project idea was approved by our professor, Vignesh Sir took over, guiding us on how to create interactive, visually appealing, and functional designs. He taught us how to integrate navigation links, interactive buttons, and other essential elements to build a user-friendly interface. <br><br>
            
            For our project, our team is addressing issues in government hospitals, such as long queues for bill payments, complicated registration procedures, and delays at cash counters. The application we are developing aims to simplify these processes and streamline the experience for patients. The app will feature an intuitive home page with clear navigation options to registration, bill payment, and other services. The registration page will allow users to input personal information, upload necessary documents, and make online payments securely. <br><br>
            
            After defining the app's flow, we began using the design tool to bring our ideas to life. We focused on developing key elements and designing page layouts, while also testing the prototype's basic functionality. This practical session emphasized the importance of planning the user journey and creating a seamless experience. By the end of the session, we had established the overall structure of our application and started building the digital prototype. This phase equipped us with the tools necessary to turn our ideas into real, impactful solutions. <br><br>
            
            </div>
</div>
<h1>Synthesis</h1>
<div class="Synthesis" id="Synthesis">
    <div class="text">
        "Government hospitals often face significant inefficiencies in their payment processes, leading to long queues at cash counters and creating undue stress for both patients and staff. These delays are primarily caused by outdated systems that heavily rely on manual payment methods, limited digital payment options, and inadequate resources to manage the high volume of transactions. As a result, patients frequently experience delays in receiving treatment due to the time spent waiting for payments to be processed.   <br><br>

To address these challenges, we are designing an innovative app that digitizes and optimizes the payment process.  
 <br><br>
Key features of the app will include:   <br><br>
- Online bill payments -- to eliminate reliance on physical cash counters.   <br><br>
- Integration with appointment schedules -- for seamless pre-payments.   <br><br>
- Secure and diverse payment options -- for enhanced user trust.   <br><br>
- Real-time payment tracking -- for transparency and convenience.   <br><br>

By implementing this solution, we aim to significantly reduce waiting times, improve resource management, and create a streamlined, patient-centric system. This digital transformation will enhance the experience for all stakeholders and boost the operational efficiency of government hospitals." <br><br>

    </div>
    <div class="text">
        For our project, our team aims to address key challenges faced in government hospitals, such as long queues for bill payments, complex and time-consuming registration procedures, and overcrowding at cash counters. Our proposed application is designed to simplify these processes, making them more efficient and patient-friendly.   <br><br>

The application's design and flow were carefully brainstormed to ensure an intuitive and seamless user experience. Starting from the (home page), the app will feature a clear and user-friendly navigation menu that guides patients to various facilities, such as (registration), (bill payments), and other essential services.   <br><br>

The (registration pages) will allow users to provide their personal information and securely upload required documents. This streamlined process will enable patients to complete their registration online, significantly reducing the need for in-person visits. Additionally, the app will facilitate (secure online bill payments), incorporating robust security measures to protect user data and transactions.   <br><br>

By simplifying registration, enabling online payments, and offering a smooth and secure user experience, the application aims to minimize waiting times, enhance convenience, and improve the overall efficiency of government hospital services. <br><br>

        After determining the flow of the app, we began using a design tool to bring our ideas to life. We collaborated closely on developing key elements and crafting page layouts, while also testing the prototype to ensure its basic functionality. This hands-on session gave us valuable insights into the importance of carefully planning the user journey and ensuring a seamless experience throughout.   <br><br>

By the end of the session, we had successfully developed the overall structure of our application and initiated the process of building the digital prototype. This phase equipped us with the necessary tools and practical experience to transform our ideas into real, working solutions that have the potential to make a meaningful impact. <br><br>
